            Creating exceptional user interfaces requires attention to detail, 
            understanding of design principles, and empathy for users.

        <h3 class="article-subheading">Key Principles</h3>
        
        <p class="article-body">
            Great design is invisible. Users shouldn't have to think about how to use your interface. 
            Every element should have a clear purpose and follow consistent patterns throughout the application.
        </p>

            <strong>Tip:</strong> Test your designs with real users early and often. 
            Their feedback is invaluable for creating intuitive experiences.

            Accessibility isn't just about compliance—it's about ensuring everyone can use your product 
            effectively. Consider colour contrast, text sizing, and keyboard navigation from the start.
